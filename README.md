QuestCameraKit is a collection of template and reference projects demonstrating how to use Meta Quest‚Äôs new **Passthrough Camera API** `(PCA)` for advanced AR/VR vision, tracking, and shader effects.

Overview
========

The repository includes the following sample projects:

1. üé® Color Picker
   --------------------------------
   - **Purpose:** Convert a 3D point in space to its corresponding 2D image pixel.
   - **Description:** This sample shows the mapping between 3D space and 2D image coordinates using the Passthrough Camera API. We use MRUK's EnvironmentRaycastManager to determine a 3D point in our environment and map it to the location on our WebcamTexture. We then extract the pixel on that point, to determine the color of a real world object.

2. üçé Object Detection with Unity Sentis
   --------------------------------
   - **Purpose:** Use the Unity Sentis framework to infer different ML models to detect and track objects.
   - **Description:** Learn how to convert detected image coordinates (e.g. bounding boxes) back into 3D points for dynamic interaction within your scenes. In this sample you will also see how to filter labels. This means e.g. you can only detect humans and pets, to create a more safe play-area for your VR game. The sample video below is filtered to monitor, person and laptop.

3. üì± QR Code Tracking with ZXing
   --------------------------------
   - **Purpose:** Detect and track QR codes in real time.
   - **Description:** Similarly to the object detection sample, get QR code coordinated and projects them into 3D space. Detect QR codes and call their URLs.

4. ü™ü Frosted Glass Shader
   --------------------------------
   - **Purpose:** Apply a custom frosted glass shader effect to virtual surfaces.
   - **Description:** A shader which takes our camera feed as input to blur the content behind it. I know you want the Apple Vision Pro forsted glass üëÄ

5. üß† OpenAI vision model & voice commands
   --------------------------------
   - **Purpose:** Ask OpenAI's vision model (or any other multi-modal LLM) for context of your current scene.
   - **Description:** In this sample we implement a simple connection to OpenAI's vision model. Additionally it is connected to Meta's Voice SDK for easy voice commands. The goal is to send an image to an LLM, using a simple wake workd and voice command, to quickly and seamleslly get an answer.

Prerequisites:
--------------
- **Meta Quest Device:** Ensure you are runnning on a Quest 3 or Quest 3s and your device is updated to HorizonOS v74 or later.
- **Unity:** Recommended version 6 (unity 6000.0.39f1). Also runs on Unity 2022 LTS.
- **Passthrough Camera API:** Follow Meta Quest‚Äôs documentation to enable and configure the API. The API is part of the Meta XR Core SDK v74 or later.
- **Sentis Framework:** For image tracking samples, refer to the Sentis documentation for installation and setup.
- **Camera Passthrough API does not work in the Editor or XR Simulator.**

Installation:
-------------
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Run the following command in your terminal:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/QuestVisionKit.git

2. **Open the Project in Unity:**
Launch Unity and open the cloned project folder.

3. **Configure Dependencies:**
Follow the instructions in the section below to run one of the samples.

Running the Samples
===================

- **Color Picker**
  - Open the `ColorPicker` scene and run the application.
  - Build the scene and run the APK on your headset.
  - Use your controller, aim the ray onto a surface in your real space and press the trigger to observe the corresponding pixel from the passthrough camera feed.

- **Object Detection with Unity Sentis**
  - Open the `ObjectDetection` scene.
  - You will need Unity Sentis for this project to run (com.unity.sentis).
  - Select the labels you would like to track. No label means all objects will be tracked.
  - Build the scene and run the APK on your headset. Look around your room and see how tracked objects receive a bounding box in accurate 3D space.

- **QR Code Tracking**
  - Open the `QRCodeTracking` scene to test real-time QR code detection and tracking.
  - You will need to install [NuGet for Unity]()
  - After install you will have a new Menu `NuGet`. Click on it and then on `Manage NuGet Packages`. Search for the [ZXing.Net package](https://github.com/micjahn/ZXing.Net/) from Michael Jahn and install it.
  - Build the scene and run the APK on your headset. Look at a QR code to see the marker in 3D space and URL of the QR code.

- **Frosted Glass Shader**
  - Open the `FrostedGlass` scene.
  - Build the scene and run the APK on your headset.
  - Look at the panel from different angles and observe how objects behind it are blurred.

- **OpenAI vision model & voice commands**
   - Open the `OpenAIVision` scene.
   - Build the scene and run the APK on your headset.
